# Tabletop Baseball Manager Demo

Welcome to Tabletop Baseball Manager, a new tabletop baseball game that puts you in the manager's seat for all game-level decisions. Using unique situation cards you'll be put right into the action at the start of each inning then have to work your way out of the inning to score or prevent runs. 

This is a first-run demo of the game. The purpose of this demo is to get gamers playing who will provide valuable feedback on the direction of the game. So download and print the components, roll some games, and please let me know what can be improved or added to create the best manager game on the market. 

## A note on realism

The goal of the game is on managing game situations. With every at bat the situation changes and so must the strategies. A series of risks and rewards are built into the manager cards and "playing the percentages" doesn't always work out positively. The emphasis on the game is not to be a true-to-life simulation of baseball, like many other tabletop sims. There should be some realism with players performing similar to their capabilities but *it will not be exact*. Generally, however, a power hitter like Barry Bonds should hit with more power than a slap hitter like Ozzie Smith. 

Because this is not a simulation, and because batters don't have chances to hit in every inning, accurate stats cannot be kept for this game. What counts the most is the final outcome, the situations to be managed, and the performance of the batter and pitcher during the present at bat. That said, substitutions are possible and can improve the chances of scoring or preventing runs.

## Gameplay

The best way to figure out how to play the game is to watch the [games I've played on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvQQ08OtlzFsek11aYKtIjCUOVm9ogkjB).

### Getting started

Set up your lineups on the scorecard. It will speed up the game to add the players' ratings (A-E) right on the scorecard near their names.

Shuffle the Situation Cards, Ground Ball cards, and Fly Ball cards, putting them face down in separate piles. You'll need space to flip the cards. Separate the Manager Cards so they are easily accessible throughout the game. Arrange them in a way that makes the most sense to you.

Place a marker on the scorecard for each team. You'll need to use the marker to keep track of which player is currently at bat. TBM is not typically a "next man up" type of game. There should also be 4 markers on the game board--1 to keep track of outs and 3 to set the situation on the bases.

### Playing the game

Each inning starts by turning over the top Situation Card and setting the situation on the game board. Use the markers/tokens to set the baserunners and outs. Then look at the small number on the top right of the Situation Card you turned over. This will tell you how many batters to move the team marker/token. This will show you the player who is at bat to begin the inning.

To begin the at bat you will roll the 2 D6s then add the numbers together. So if one die result is 3 and the other is 2, then the roll result is a 5. Check the batter's rating (A-E) and then reference the roll number (5 in this case) with the appropriate card on the game board. The cards representing hitters A-E are printed right on the bottom of the game board for easy reference. 

For this at bat, let's assume the batter is an A batter. A roll of 5 on the A batter card is FB (Fly Ball). You will then flip over the top card of the Fly Ball pile. There are 4 results on the Fly Ball and Ground Ball cards (A-D). Again, reference the batter's rating (A-E) and read the play based on his rating. Record the result of the play.

If the play result does not end the inning then reset the game board based on the play result and move the scorecard marker to the next batter. Continue playing until there are three outs in the inning.

### Manager cards

The game comes with Manager cards that can be utilized by both the offense and defense. The defense cards are separated into infield and outfield cards. Cards are played at the beginning of each at bat and can be used as much or little as players want to use them. They can also be used together. For instance, you can play the infield in and outfield in at the same time, but you can't play the infield in and at double play depth at the same time. In another example, the outfield can be played back and also shifted to the left at the same time.

Once a card is played, follow the instructions on the card. Some are used while the play is happening (like tagging up or taking an extra base) and some have results that are dependent upon where the ball is hit (like the double play depth card) or the quality of the hit (to the warning track or a blooper). If the card indicates an extra roll in a particular situation then you must roll the 2 D6s again to find the result. Use the result that is on the card as the outcome of the play.

## Game roadmap

These are things that I'm working on adding for the future. Any suggestions are appreciated.

- Creating a proper Guide for the game
- Adding pitcher ratings/interaction
- Creating pitchers for rosters
- Creating power ratings for batters and pitchers that will determine HRs
